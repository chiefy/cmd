	<h1>Overview</h1>
	
	<p>Cmd.io is a service that remotely runs commands and scripts. The primary
interface to Cmd.io is SSH, meaning you can use Cmd.io commands from any host
with an SSH client. A couple of use cases for Cmd.io include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>CLI utilities as a service.</strong> Example, bring <code>jq</code> wherever you go, without installing it.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid installing big CLI programs.</strong> Example, <code>latex</code> is huge and difficult to build but used infrequently.</li>
<li><strong>Scripts you can use from anywhere.</strong> Trigger and orchestrate other systems using any language.</li>
<li><strong>Share and control access to automation.</strong> Build tools for your team or Rickroll your friends.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cmd.io commands can run any x86 64-bit program in an Linux Docker container.
However, it&rsquo;s designed for commands and scripts as opposed to long-running
daemons. In fact, commands can only run for a limited time before they timeout.
So Cmd.io is also not suitable for replacing your shell. Kudos for such a clever
idea, though.</p>

<p>Commands are unable to listen on routable ports, which is not common with most
commands anyway. In the rare cases you need to, such as debugging with netcat,
consider using a tool like <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a>.</p>

<p>Another important constraint of commands is that they are stateless. Besides
configured environment variables, nothing persists across command runs. If the
command makes a file, it will not be there the next time you run it. Utilities
that expect files on the filesystem will need to be wrapped so they can receive
the file(s) via STDIN.</p>
